# Portfolio Page Made With Flexbox

## My Task

This project was made to help me to learn how to position elements on a webpage using flexbox. This is something that I wanted to get better at so learning this skill was a big motivation for doing this project. The website is a portfolio page that showcases projects that I will work on in the future. It also has an about me section and links to contact me. This is a dummy website as of now however I may adjust it in the future and use it to showcase all my projects in one place. I wanted to make it look similar to the mock up design but to add my own styling and design to make it unique but at the same time it has to achieve the following requirements as shown below:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
